# Travel Log

This is the record of everywhere I’ve been.  
Some trails are colder than others, but every destination leaves a mark.

Of all the cities, only Truth or Consequences ever made me pause.

I kept track of the first, lost the second, lingered too long at the third, and never returned to the fourth.

The fifth? That one’s not a place at all.

Somewhere along the line, the journey changed me.  
Only the sharpest agents will know which stop mattered most.

Not all journeys have an end.
